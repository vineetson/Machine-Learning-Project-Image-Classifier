# Introduction

<br></br>
This article explores a Machine Learning algorithm called Convolution Neural Network (CNN), it's a common Deep Learning technique used for image recognition and classification.

<br></br>
Dataset consists of 5,000 Cat images and 5,000 Dog images. We are going to train a Machine Learning model to learn differences between the two categories. The model will predict if a new unseen image is a Cat or Dog. The code architecture is robust and can be used to recognize any number of image categories, if provided with enough data.

# Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)

<br></br>
Convolution Neural Networks are good for pattern recognition and feature detection which is especially useful in image classification. Improve the performance of Convolution Neural Networks through hyper-parameter tuning, adding more convolution layers, adding more fully connected layers, or providing more correctly labeled data to the algorithm.

# Code

<br></br>
Download the code and run it with 'Jupyter Notebook' or copy the code into the 'Spyder' IDE found in the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 'Spyder' is similar to MATLAB, it allows you to step through the code and examine the 'Variable Explorer' to see exactly how the data is parsed and analyzed. Jupyter Notebook also offers a [Jupyter Variable Explorer Extension](http://volderette.de/jupyter-notebook-variable-explorer/) which is quite useful for keeping track of variables.
